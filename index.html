        The did:tag DID method enables any controller of an HTTP accessible
        domain or subdomain, or an email address, to create unique,
        interoperable DIDs with minimal dependencies on other technologies or
        systems. By leveraging a subset of the tagURI specification [[RFC4151]],
        the did:tag DID method enables the creation of DIDs which are "unique
        across space and time while being tractable to humans," without
        preventing the creation of DIDs which are largely intractable and
        unlikely to remain unique across time. did:tag DIDs can be resolved
        either synchronously, via the web, or asynchronously, via email or other
        defined alternative resolution services.

    <section>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        The goal of this proposal is to go beyond the already good work done
        with other DID methods and address several issues for which solutions
        are not already satisfactorially provided. The key issues addressed here
        include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The persistence of identifiers and methods for maintaining the
          uniqueness in time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Expanding the realm of DID issuers to include all those who have an
          email addresses.
        </li>
        <li>Asynchronous access to DID documents.</li>
        <li>The provision of alternative DID resolution mechanisms.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <b>Persistence:</b> It is generally accepted that ideal distributed
        identifiers would be memorable, secure from misappropriation, and
        globally unique. But, an identifier should also not become less
        memorable as time passes, or less secure, or less likely to be unique.
        Thus, to the set of three basic naming qualities, we should add a fourth
        quality; that of persistence. [[?ZOOKOS-TETRAHEDRON]]
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
        <img src="WymansTetrahedron.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, as Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn [[?ZOOKOS-TRIANGLE]] pointed out
        in 2001, it is not possible to simultaneously optimize all of the base
        qualities of decentralized identifiers. For example: identifiers may be
        secure, global, and even likely to remain so for quite some time,
        perhaps by using very long cryptographic hash functions to mint them,
        but such names are typically not very memorable, at least not by human
        beings. Thus, our process for creating names needs to incorporate a
        tradeoff between the various desirable attributes of ideal identifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web DIDs do a good job of addressing three of the desirable qualities of
        a decentralized identifier. [[?WEB-DID]] The DID Document provides the
        data needed to make them secure, the ability to structure them with
        human readable components allows them to be memorable, and their linkage
        to DNS records provides an ability to ensure that they are unique by
        limiting the number of those who can mint them.
      </p>
      <pre
        class="example"
        title="A Web DID, memorable, unique, secure, but not peristent."
      >
        did:web:example.com:user:alice
      </pre>
      <p>
        However, while an issuer of Web DIDs may work hard to ensure that
        duplicate DIDs are not issued, maintaining uniqueness over time can be
        challenging. A Web DID might be issued to a user named Alice in one
        year, but then Alice may cease to become a user in some future year.
        Once that happens, some new Alice may wish to have the simple, memorable
        identifer "user:alice," but be told that that identifier was issued to a
        long-gone user in some previous year. Similarly, domain names tend to
        change owners over time. Thus, a new service owner may not even be aware
        that there had once been an Alice served by some previous owner. As a
        result, a new DID might be issued to an Alice only to discover that it
        appears to conflict with DID issued earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        These issues of identifier persistence were considered and addressed in
        the preparation of the IETF's tagURI scheme. [[RFC4151]] The solution
        was to define a scheme, very much like that used for Web DIDs and URLs
        in general, but with an added element that specifies a date during which
        the issuer of the identifier claims to have been the controller of the
        domain name incorporated within the name. Using tagURIs, it then becomes
        possible to create only slightly less memorable names for multiple
        Alice's at different times. For instance, the following are several
        possible tagURIs that might identify different Alice's without conflict
        and that could be each minted by a different issuer without a need to
        know of any earlier issuer using the same domain name.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="tagURIs for several unique Alices">
            tag:example.com,2000:user:alice
            tag:example.com,2050:user:alice
            tag:example.com,2090-10-15:user:alice
            tag:example.com,2090-10-16:user:alice
    </pre
      >
      <p>
        In order to gain the benefits of persistence provided by tagURIs, this
        proposal describes a DID method that relies on tagURIs as its base
        rather than the web URLs which were the focus of the Web DID.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Enabling all to be issuers:</b> Ideally, everyone would be able to
        generate useful DIDs without needing to rely on other issuers. However,
        most existing DID methods assume that an issuer has ready access to
        services that are not commanded by the majority of users. Even something
        as "simple" as a web site is far beyond the capacity of many.
        Nonetheless, individuals often have needs to generate identifiers and
        would feel that their self-sovereignty was constrainted if they could
        not do so without relying on others. Their needs could be addressed by
        providing a mechanism for minting DIDs from tagURIs which incorporate an
        email address rather than a domain name. For instance, the following are
        valid tagURIs incorporating email addresses:
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="tagURIs using email addresses">
          tag:john@example.com,2000:sender_key
          tag:paul@example.com,2021:living_room_tv
          tag:admin@example.com
      </pre>
      <p>
        The simplest way to support such email-based identifiers would be to
        define a resolution method that allows one to send an email message to
        the specified address and whose response should be another email message
        containing the requested DID Document as an attachment. Such a system
        could be implemented by having custom software monitor traffic to a
        particular email inbox. It could also be implemented using completely
        manual means. A "john@example.com" might recieve a message with a
        subject of
        <code>did:tag:john@example.com,2000:sender_key</code> and know that the
        desired response was an email with the DID document as an attachment.
        With only a little difficulty, the appropriate response could be
        prepared and sent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Asynchronous Resolution:</b> An email based DID resolution method,
        unlike a web-based method, allows asynchronous DID resolution. In some
        cases, the resolution might occur hours, days, even weeks after a
        request was made. But, even a very slow response might actually have
        been the fastest possible response. An asynchronous resolution
        capability would be particularly useful in environments when
        connectivity is difficult to maintain or where bandwidth is very slow.
        As an extreme example, it is very unlikely that one would be successful
        in using https to fetch a DID document from a web server in New York
        City if one were making the request from a habitat on Mars or one of its
        moons.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Alternative DID resolution mechanisms. </b> Just as web addresses can
        sometimes be temporarily unavailable due to technical issues, a web
        addresses' availability is sometimes precluded by local or regional
        administrative policy. One's employer, or one's government, might block
        web access to sites that traffic in either pornography or discussions of
        human rights and liberty. However, even though a user may be blocked
        from accessing a web site, and thus from resolving DIDs on that site, it
        is often the case that it is possible to exchange email with addresses
        on that site, if only because email doesn't require direct,
        point-to-point connections. Thus, it is useful to define a mechanism by
        which even a normally web-accessible DID document could be retrieved via
        email protocols. In order to provide this mechanism, I propose that an
        ``AltResolution'' service be provided as a means to inform users of an
        alternative to web based DID resolution.

      <section>
        <h2>Target system</h2>
        <p>
          The target system of the tag DID method is the web host that the
          domain name included in the DID resolves to when queried through the
          Domain Name System (DNS).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Method name</h2>
        <p>
          The namestring that shall identify this DID method is:
          <code>tag</code>. A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the
          following prefix: <code>did:tag</code>. Per the DID specification,
          this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the
          prefix, is specified below.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Any directories or subdirectories included in the tagURI should be

          <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
          <p>Creating a web-accessbile DID is done by:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              applying at a domain name registrar for use of a domain name and
            </li>
            <li>
              storing the location of a hosting service, the IP address at a DNS

            </li>
            <li>
              creating the DID document JSON-LD file and storing the
              <code>did.json</code> file under the .well-known/did_tag URL to
              represent the entire domain, or under the specified path if many
              DIDs will be resolved in this domain.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            For example, for the domain name `www.example.com`, the `did.json`

            <p>
              The following steps MUST be executed to resolve the DID document
              from a tag DID whose authorityName is a DNSname:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Extract the DNSname from the tagURI.</li>
              <li>
                Generate an HTTPS URL to the expected location of the DID
                document by prepending the DNSname with <code>https://</code>.
              </li>
              <li>To that string, append <code>/.well-known/did_tag</code>.</li>
              <li>
                If the tagURI contains a date, replace any colons within the
                date with slashes, prepend a slash, and append it to the string.
              </li>
              <li>
                if the tagURI contains a specific component, replace all colons
                within it with slashes ('/') and append it to the string
              </li>
              <li>Append <code>/did.json</code> to complete the URL.</li>
              <li>
                Perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> request to the URL using an
                agent that can successfully negotiate a secure HTTPS connection,
                which enforces the security requirements as described in

              </li>

            When performing the DNS resolution during the HTTP
            <code>GET</code> request, the client SHOULD utilize
            <div RFC8484=""></div>
            in order to prevent Man-in-the-middle attacks as well as to prevent
            tracking of the lookup.

            <h4>Resolving a DID via email</h4>
            <p>
              The following steps MUST be executed to resolve the DID document
              from a tag DID whose authorityName is an emailAddress:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Extract the emailAddress from the tagURI.</li>
              <li>Replace the at-sign ('@') with <code>+tag@</code></li>
              <li>
                Send an email message to the emailAddress with a subject line
                containing the DID.
              </li>
              <li>
                If and when a response is delivered, the DID Document will be
                found in an attachment to the response.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="issue">
              Should an email resolver be permitted to, or trusted to, resolve
              web-accessbile DIDs on behalf of email correspondents? This seems
              like a great opportunity to establish man-in-the-middle attacks.
              How could that be prevented? In some cases, there may be no
              alternative.

          <h3>Update</h3>
          <p>
            To update the DID document, the <code>did.json</code> has to be
            updated. Please note that the DID will remain the same, but the
            contents of the DID document could change, e.g., by including a new
            verification key or adding service endpoints.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that this DID method does not specify any authentication
            or authorization mechanism for writing to the DID Document. It is
            left to implementations to protect DID documents from modification
            by an attacker.

          <h3>Deactivate (Revoke)</h3>
          <p>
            To delete the DID document, the <code>did.json</code> has to be
            removed or has to be no longer publicly available due to any other
            means.

          <h3>Optional Path Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            When optional paths to DID documents are used to resolve documents
            rather than bare domains, verification with signed data proves that
            the entity in control of the file indicated in the path has the
            private keys. It does not prove that the domain operator has the
            private keys.
          </p>

          <p>This example:</p>

          <pre class="nohighlight">
did:tag:example.com:u:bob
          </pre>
          <p>resolves to the DID document at:</p>
          <pre class="nohighlight">
https://example.com/.well-known/did_tag/u/bob/did.json
          </pre>
          <p>
            In this scenario, it is probable that example.com has given user Bob
            control over the DID in question, and proofs of control refer to Bob
            rather than all of example.com.
